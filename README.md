Hi, I’m YourAverageYeet (real name Mike Hensley)
- I am a developer interested in developing backends and tooling and use both C and Python to accomplish this interest.
- I have a vested interest in older computers and systems like the Commodore 64 and DOS.
- Personally, I am currently working on a custom sprite format in C ([mhit](https://github.com/YourAverageYeet/mhit)), and a hand-written, 6502-assembly-based note-taking application for the C64 (not on GitHub... yet?).
- I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can help on, though prefer to work on more backend-related things than frontend (the best I can do frontend-wise os FLTK).
- How to reach me:
  1. Email: [mike2@tamu.edu](mailto:mike2@tamu.edu?subject=I%20saw%20you%20on%20GitHub%20and%20wished%20to%20reach%20out)
  2. Discord: @yeetusff
