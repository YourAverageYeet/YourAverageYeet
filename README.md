- 👋 Hi, I’m @YourAverageYeet
- 👀 I’m interested in C++ and Python programming, along with old computers like the Commodore 64.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning classes and stuff for C++, GUIs for Python, and 6502 (technically 6510) ASM for the C64.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can help on.
- 📫 How to reach me:
